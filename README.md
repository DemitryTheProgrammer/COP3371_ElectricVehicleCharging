# COP3371_ElectricVehicleCharging

This database application is designed to track and analyze electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure, usage patterns, and station availability. The system enables users to locate affordable charging stations within a specific radius and allows administrators to perform location-based optimization and utilization ranking.

----

Unique Challenges:

Dynamic Availability: Tracking real-time "Occupied" vs. "Available" status across different connector types.

Geospatial Integration: Efficiently querying station proximity for users.

Usage Patterns: Analyzing charging sessions to predict peak demand and optimize pricing.
 
----
 
User Groups:

EV Drivers: Search for stations, check pricing, and view real-time availability.

Station Operators: Monitor hardware performance, manage pricing, and view utilization reports.

City Planners: Access analytics on high-demand areas to plan future infrastructure.
