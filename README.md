# COP3371_ElectricVehicleCharging

This database application is designed to track and analyze electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure, usage patterns, and station availability. The system enables users to locate affordable charging stations within a specific radius and allows administrators to perform location-based optimization and utilization ranking.

Unique Challenges:
\nDynamic Availability: Tracking real-time "Occupied" vs. "Available" status across different connector types.
\nGeospatial Integration: Efficiently querying station proximity for users.
\nUsage Patterns: Analyzing charging sessions to predict peak demand and optimize pricing.

User Groups:
\nEV Drivers: Search for stations, check pricing, and view real-time availability.
\nStation Operators: Monitor hardware performance, manage pricing, and view utilization reports.
\nCity Planners: Access analytics on high-demand areas to plan future infrastructure.
